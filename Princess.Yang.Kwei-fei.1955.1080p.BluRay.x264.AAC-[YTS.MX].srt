00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:26,110
- We have come to take you away, sire
- Please make yourself ready

15
00:03:26,216 --> 00:03:29,208
Where are you taking me?

16
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,852
- To the Palace of the West, sire
- What?

17
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,685
The Palace of the West?

18
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,521
You're going to confine me there?

19
00:03:37,627 --> 00:03:39,219
- Yes, sire
- No!

20
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,926
I refuse to leave here

21
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:45,958
I shall remain here

22
00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:49,766
Here, at least I can listen
to the sounds of the city...

23
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:53,969
...and there are many distractions
to console me in my solitude

24
00:03:56,613 --> 00:03:59,673
Go tell the Emperor that

25
00:04:00,917 --> 00:04:03,818
Tell my son...

26
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,186
...not to cause his old father
any further suffering

27
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:10,517
But it is the Emperor's order

28
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:13,095
We must carry out his imperial order
to the letter

29
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:15,494
Please, make yourself ready to leave

30
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,567
You insult me!

31
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,862
Get out!

32
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,096
Out!

33
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:23,903
Out!

34
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,585
<i>Kuei-fei...</i>

35
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:47,725
<i>Kuei-fei...</i>

36
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:50,857
<i>Where are you, my love?</i>

37
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:57,938
<i>Are you watching over me</i>
<i>from somewhere beyond the grave?</i>

38
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:02,936
<i>Alas, I am too old now...</i>

39
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:07,710
<i>... for any pleasures</i>
<i>this world may offer me</i>

40
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:12,180
<i>I wish only to see you again</i>

41
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:16,986
<i>Any place without your presence...</i>

42
00:05:17,093 --> 00:05:21,689
<i>... is unbearable to me</i>

43
00:05:22,198 --> 00:05:24,257
<i>Kuei-fei...</i>

44
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:26,763
<i>... where are you?</i>

45
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,218
Well done.
You all played very well

46
00:06:17,687 --> 00:06:20,918
I wasn't too sure of the piece at first...

47
00:06:21,024 --> 00:06:23,993
...but I very much enjoyed your rendition

48
00:06:24,094 --> 00:06:28,292
I think it is one of Your Majesty's
masterpieces

49
00:06:28,398 --> 00:06:34,667
However, there is a certain
underlying sadness to it, sire

50
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:43,404
How can you expect me to compose
anything joyous, the way I feel?

51
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:48,741
Majesty, you are the most
fortunate person in the Empire

52
00:06:51,021 --> 00:06:54,047
Look at me, do I really
seem that fortunate?

53
00:06:55,892 --> 00:06:59,419
Fortune is not a mere corollary
of one's social status

54
00:07:00,864 --> 00:07:03,833
If I were truly fortunate...

55
00:07:03,933 --> 00:07:07,699
...then I would be able to compose
more joyous pieces of music

56
00:07:07,804 --> 00:07:12,366
This piece was composed
in honour of my late wife

57
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:20,410
Well... let us play the next movement

58
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:49,375
Your Majesty...

59
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:52,744
...Premier Li wishes
for an audience with you...

60
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:56,148
...to discuss pressing affairs of state

61
00:07:56,252 --> 00:07:59,881
And as your schedule
must be strictly observed...

62
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:03,425
...I must ask you kindly
to finish now for today

63
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,854
Thank you, everybody

64
00:08:05,962 --> 00:08:07,122
Wait

65
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,391
I just want to try this last piece

66
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,263
Premier Li, you can wait a little longer

67
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:15,828
I fear I cannot, Majesty

68
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:22,268
Besides myself, you are to address
several foreign ambassadors, sire

69
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:25,313
We also have to plan
your journey details

70
00:08:25,415 --> 00:08:29,943
Affairs of state must always
take precedence, sire

71
00:08:35,058 --> 00:08:39,495
You constantly interfere
with my pleasures...

72
00:08:39,796 --> 00:08:43,129
...and bind me to ridiculous
schedules and ceremonies!

73
00:08:51,808 --> 00:08:55,767
You distract His Majesty
from his duties of governance

74
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:57,278
Get out!

75
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,952
- Majesty...
- What is it?

76
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:08,956
Please look at this statue
of the Bodhisattva...

77
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:13,085
...that came in tribute
from the Silla Kingdom of Korea

78
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:18,361
She is truly a work of great beauty

79
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:25,140
And who is this?

80
00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:29,569
You honour me
by giving her recognition, Majesty

81
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,542
I have taken the liberty of selecting
this highly capable lady...

82
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,943
...to take care of all your needs, sire

83
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,952
It's unnecessary

84
00:09:38,054 --> 00:09:41,046
Nobody can take the place
of the late Empress

85
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:07,409
Just forget about it

86
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:16,622
I heard that His Majesty
turned her down

87
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:22,130
Did he refuse you?

88
00:10:22,232 --> 00:10:24,257
It wasn't your fault

89
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:28,497
We may be the most beautiful
women in the capital...

90
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:33,099
...but we're just not beautiful enough
for His Imperial Majesty, that's all!

91
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:37,579
You just have to accept your fate
with good grace

92
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,997
Oh, welcome, sire!

93
00:10:56,099 --> 00:10:58,397
General An Lu-shan has arrived!

94
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,298
Welcome

95
00:11:02,272 --> 00:11:04,638
Oh, welcome, sire

96
00:11:04,941 --> 00:11:08,138
What a shame. I really thought
your daughter would be accepted

97
00:11:08,244 --> 00:11:11,236
She failed, despite all your intercessions
on our behalf

98
00:11:11,347 --> 00:11:12,974
What a shame

99
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:20,083
That's put an end
to all our plans, General

100
00:11:20,189 --> 00:11:22,453
Not so. All is not lost yet

101
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:26,050
Her acceptance would have
hastened things along, that's all

102
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:29,290
All our hopes are dashed

103
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:32,562
She's the third sister to be rejected

104
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:37,300
I'll end up working here
and never getting on in life

105
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:42,075
General, please take me with you
to your fortress

106
00:11:42,178 --> 00:11:47,081
- And what would you do there?
- But I've no future here in the capital

107
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,617
I'd rather be an official under you,
General...

108
00:11:49,719 --> 00:11:53,712
...then I could take bribes
and get rich quick!

109
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,254
You sound desperate,
and I don't hire such desperate men

110
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,523
I'll worry about it later.
General, let's have a drink

111
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,962
- Good
- Come right this way

112
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:06,365
- Let's drink
- You go on ahead...

113
00:12:09,272 --> 00:12:11,706
What's up with you? Look lively!

114
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:15,102
Master Kao will be arriving soon.
Let's go

115
00:12:15,211 --> 00:12:24,176
<i>Even on the branches of the willows</i>
<i>Throughout the town...</i>

116
00:12:41,738 --> 00:12:44,434
Hey, the guests have arrived!
Stop that singing!

117
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,442
- Who is she?
- She's my youngest cousin

118
00:12:48,544 --> 00:12:50,136
Same family as the others?

119
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:54,580
She's their half-sister. A country girl,
just arrived from the mountains

120
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,746
- General?
- Wait...

121
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,445
So, you're a daughter
of the Yang family?

122
00:13:25,548 --> 00:13:27,641
I'm more like their servant

123
00:13:33,156 --> 00:13:34,453
Hey!

124
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:36,115
Show me your face

125
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:39,251
Please leave me alone,
I have work to do

126
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:42,054
Hey!

127
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,566
What are you doing?

128
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,533
What are you doing to me?

129
00:13:53,743 --> 00:13:55,176
What...?

130
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,510
You're quite a beauty

131
00:14:02,618 --> 00:14:04,518
Let go of me!

132
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,297
You're wasted here in the kitchen

133
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:28,306
General! What are you doing
in this place?

134
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:30,641
- I've just found a real treasure
- What?

135
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:33,146
This one, here!

136
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,786
That was a real shame
your daughter was rejected

137
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:50,423
No, not at all, one can't expect
the daughter of a mere restaurateur...

138
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:53,525
...to attract the attention of His Majesty

139
00:14:53,636 --> 00:14:57,299
It was our fault for thinking
above our station

140
00:14:57,406 --> 00:15:00,500
What do you mean, brother,
that it was our fault?

141
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,602
You want to run this restaurant
for the rest of your life?

142
00:15:03,713 --> 00:15:06,409
Well, I don't! I want to be someone
and get on in life!

143
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:08,313
I just think differently from you

144
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,875
You want to use your daughters
to further your own ambitions

145
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:16,625
What's wrong with that? I'm doing it
for the honour of the Yang Family

146
00:15:16,726 --> 00:15:19,194
For the prosperity of the whole family

147
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,456
I'm only doing the right thing

148
00:15:21,564 --> 00:15:23,225
No, your motives are evil...

149
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:24,663
Stop

150
00:15:27,937 --> 00:15:30,735
- Let me see how you look in these
- No!

151
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,865
Don't answer back! Put them on quickly!

152
00:15:33,176 --> 00:15:35,906
If I put those on,
everyone will just laugh at me!

153
00:15:36,212 --> 00:15:38,180
What a child! Come here

154
00:15:39,182 --> 00:15:41,912
I'm just a country peasant

155
00:15:42,218 --> 00:15:46,655
Since my mother died, I've been forced
to work as a maid in the kitchens

156
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:49,281
You treat me worse than a dog!

157
00:15:49,392 --> 00:15:51,587
Everyone has to start somewhere

158
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:56,826
Take me for instance, my father
was a foreigner in this country

159
00:15:56,933 --> 00:16:00,960
I suffered enormous prejudice
and was maltreated as a child

160
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,769
But human beings have a destiny...

161
00:16:04,874 --> 00:16:08,640
...and if you don't grasp at good fortune
then you'll regret it for life

162
00:16:08,744 --> 00:16:12,612
Don't you see, you have been presented
with a wonderful opportunity?

163
00:16:13,516 --> 00:16:15,507
Right then, try these robes on

164
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:20,619
And then what?

165
00:16:20,723 --> 00:16:23,715
We're going to see
where your destiny lies

166
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:29,493
You've never realised
how beautiful you are?

167
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,260
No, not at all

168
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:35,963
Well, it's up to me
to convince you otherwise

169
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:41,710
But you must be aware of your beauty,
before you can convince others to see it

170
00:16:43,246 --> 00:16:44,372
Yes?

171
00:16:44,981 --> 00:16:46,608
Get dressed quickly

172
00:16:46,716 --> 00:16:51,483
Follow the General's kind advice
and put this robe on

173
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,015
Others may envy us...

174
00:16:55,324 --> 00:16:58,885
...but our low birth stops us
from progressing further

175
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:05,730
Is it only the Li family
that can gain advancement?

176
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:08,827
There's nothing we can do
about it for the present

177
00:17:08,938 --> 00:17:11,771
No one can stand in the way
of Premier Li Lin-fu

178
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:16,943
It's unfortunate the Emperor
wasn't attracted to your daughter

179
00:17:17,046 --> 00:17:22,279
He can't forget the late Empress
Wu-hui, can he?

180
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:27,054
She was a wonderful Empress

181
00:17:28,557 --> 00:17:32,459
There could be no other like her
in this world

182
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:36,725
Yes, there could be, Master Kao!
There could be another Wu-hui!

183
00:17:36,832 --> 00:17:41,394
You're not the only one who wishes
to see Empress Wu-hui reincarnated

184
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:44,302
Those who support the Emperor
wish it, too

185
00:17:45,675 --> 00:17:51,307
- Another Empress Wu-hui, you say?
- Yes, another. See for yourself

186
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,741
It's Yu-huan, isn't it?

187
00:17:56,852 --> 00:17:58,513
She's beautiful

188
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:00,088
You're such fools!

189
00:18:00,389 --> 00:18:03,790
How could you hide such a jewel
in your kitchens?

190
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:05,383
Who is this?

191
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:08,429
My youngest cousin, Yu-huan

192
00:18:49,472 --> 00:18:52,498
From here, we're heading
for the convent on Mount Li

193
00:18:52,608 --> 00:18:57,136
I will ask the Mother Abbess
to present you to His Majesty's court

194
00:18:57,446 --> 00:19:00,938
She is a relative of the Emperor
and he trusts her implicitly

195
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,780
Master Kao is already there
waiting for us

196
00:19:05,588 --> 00:19:07,920
At last, our luck is going to change

197
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:11,584
I have no doubt that you will attract
the Emperor's attention

198
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:15,687
As a reward for finding you...

199
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:21,464
...I will be called back to the capital
in triumph and made a minister

200
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:27,841
And as the highest ranking concubine,
you shall enjoy a most glorious life

201
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:32,778
You must take full advantage
of the fact that you were born beautiful

202
00:19:33,682 --> 00:19:35,013
What's wrong?

203
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:37,017
Why are you so quiet?

204
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,987
Don't you understand,
if you become an imperial concubine...

205
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,993
...great status and honour
will be bestowed upon all your family?

206
00:19:47,129 --> 00:19:51,122
And I will simply become a tool
for the family to use...

207
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:56,868
...just as I was when I was forced
to work in their kitchens

208
00:19:56,972 --> 00:20:00,499
Not at all!
This is for your own happiness

209
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:05,546
Our rewards will be
a mere fraction of yours

210
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:08,549
You must understand that

211
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:11,119
Everything will turn out just fine...

212
00:20:11,954 --> 00:20:13,148
Just fine

213
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:15,105
So, from this point onwards...

214
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:19,620
...everything about your past
will be extinguished

215
00:21:33,869 --> 00:21:37,066
What do you think of her,
Mother Abbess?

216
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:42,203
A lovely girl

217
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:52,013
- Everything is prepared, madam
- This girl is your servant

218
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:55,090
She will obey your every whim

219
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:02,120
Please allow me
to show you to your room

220
00:22:22,017 --> 00:22:25,214
Do you think she will be
to the Emperor's liking?

221
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,146
Mother Abbess...

222
00:22:29,592 --> 00:22:34,120
Just as you recommended Wu-hui
as a wife for the Emperor...

223
00:22:34,229 --> 00:22:40,134
...I would like to propose her suitability
as an imperial consort

224
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,227
Do you think the Emperor trusts you
more than he does me?

225
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:45,933
I'm not saying that at all. I mean...

226
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:47,941
Master Kao...

227
00:22:48,043 --> 00:22:51,979
...do you have any idea how much
the Emperor trusts my judgement?

228
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:55,244
- Of course I do, but...
- Then be silent!

229
00:22:55,351 --> 00:22:57,148
Yes, madam

230
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:01,052
It was I who instructed
the Empress Wu-hui

231
00:23:01,156 --> 00:23:04,057
And I will mould this girl
in the same way

232
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:09,330
You will see, I will make her
worthy of the Emperor

233
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,065
Yes, madam

234
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:25,979
His Majesty has arrived

235
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:28,709
He's walking in the Plum Tree Garden

236
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,689
I've been told to fetch you,
it's time for you to meet him

237
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:43,356
Do you think I'll be all right
dressed like this?

238
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,876
You look very beautiful

239
00:24:06,188 --> 00:24:09,282
If I am not to the Emperor's liking...

240
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:14,090
...I'll end up being confined
to his harem...

241
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,391
...to live out the rest of my days

242
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:20,100
You mustn't concern yourself
with such things

243
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:24,195
I think the Emperor will be amazed
when he sees how beautiful you are

244
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,079
What kind of a man is the Emperor?

245
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,915
What kind of things does he like?

246
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:44,791
How did Wu-hui manage
to capture his heart?

247
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,191
Please tell me

248
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:54,094
The Emperor is a very
kind-hearted person

249
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:58,105
And he greatly appreciates
people who show sincerity

250
00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:05,406
The more you listen to his music,
the more you will understand him

251
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:08,415
I see...

252
00:25:26,502 --> 00:25:29,403
It is time for you to take some tea,
Majesty

253
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:33,373
I'm enjoying looking at the plum
blossoms, I don't want any tea

254
00:25:33,475 --> 00:25:39,038
But your physician has given
strict instructions, Majesty

255
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:42,447
Why do you all constantly
try to impede me?

256
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:50,025
You don't even allow me
to enjoy my leisure as I wish

257
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:52,992
Please do not chastise me, Majesty...

258
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:58,465
...I am simply following
the strict rules of court etiquette

259
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:03,095
Please, if you would kindly make
your way to the tea house...

260
00:26:53,989 --> 00:26:55,422
Your Majesty...

261
00:27:05,868 --> 00:27:09,429
Even in the distance,
the plum blossoms look so beautiful

262
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,933
It's not only the plum blossom
that is beautiful...

263
00:27:15,043 --> 00:27:21,175
...there is also a beautiful girl
in full blossom, Majesty

264
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:32,016
I would like to express the colour and
scent of the plum blossoms in music

265
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:53,734
I would like to be left alone
this evening, please

266
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:56,510
Thank you. You may go now

267
00:28:59,214 --> 00:29:01,045
You are dismissed

268
00:29:31,446 --> 00:29:34,745
Master Kao, why are you still here?

269
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:50,162
Your Majesty, I understand your grief
at the loss of Empress Wu-hui...

270
00:29:50,265 --> 00:29:52,699
...but to continue mourning her
like this...

271
00:29:52,801 --> 00:29:56,794
I'm in no mood to listen
to your sermons this evening

272
00:29:58,573 --> 00:30:02,441
I asked you to leave me alone
this evening. Understand?

273
00:30:02,544 --> 00:30:04,239
Yes, sire

274
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:10,713
I would like to be left alone
to reminisce about my late Empress

275
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,195
Who are you?

276
00:31:08,176 --> 00:31:12,579
Who allowed you
into my private chambers?

277
00:31:17,452 --> 00:31:19,181
I know...

278
00:31:20,188 --> 00:31:22,554
This must be Kao's doing

279
00:31:26,795 --> 00:31:30,754
Because I talk so much of my late wife...

280
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:35,530
...he has taken it upon himself
to bring me a woman who looks like her

281
00:31:41,243 --> 00:31:44,440
Your resemblance to Wu-hui is uncanny

282
00:31:44,546 --> 00:31:51,247
However, it is not her body
that I yearn for, but her spirit

283
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:54,752
Majesty...

284
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:56,915
No one can replace Wu-hui

285
00:31:57,225 --> 00:32:00,251
Please don't destroy my memories

286
00:32:03,265 --> 00:32:05,256
I wish you to go now

287
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:48,675
Isn't that the piece I composed
in the Plum Tree Garden?

288
00:32:50,278 --> 00:32:51,973
You play very well

289
00:32:53,281 --> 00:32:54,714
Very well indeed

290
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:00,280
Did you learn to play that piece
to impress me?

291
00:33:02,891 --> 00:33:06,657
Or did you play it simply
to show me how clever you are?

292
00:33:06,761 --> 00:33:09,992
Not at all, Your Majesty

293
00:33:10,298 --> 00:33:12,323
Why did you play it, then?

294
00:33:14,536 --> 00:33:18,700
I merely wanted to soothe and comfort
your poor heart, Majesty...

295
00:33:18,807 --> 00:33:20,707
...if only for a short moment

296
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:25,303
My poor heart?

297
00:33:27,682 --> 00:33:29,411
Majesty...

298
00:33:29,517 --> 00:33:32,816
...I did not enter your court
of my own free will

299
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:37,782
Others will be delighted
if my presence here pleases you

300
00:33:37,892 --> 00:33:41,020
It has nothing to do with me...

301
00:33:41,329 --> 00:33:44,321
...it is the will of those
that brought me here

302
00:33:45,433 --> 00:33:49,665
I am like their puppet
and they pull my strings

303
00:33:51,506 --> 00:33:54,304
I thought I'd have to spend
the rest of my life here...

304
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,401
...like some ornament
at Your Majesty's side

305
00:33:58,813 --> 00:34:04,342
There was nothing I could do but
accept the inevitability of my destiny

306
00:34:06,354 --> 00:34:07,582
But then...

307
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:13,555
...when I realised how much love
Your Majesty still felt for Wu-hui...

308
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:18,423
...I felt ashamed of myself

309
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:28,067
Empress Wu-hui was
a very fortunate person indeed

310
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,537
I never imagined...

311
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:33,671
...that a woman
could be so loved by a man

312
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:37,016
I envy Wu-hui

313
00:34:38,887 --> 00:34:44,382
If only I could meet a man who was
as gentle and kind as Your Majesty...

314
00:34:44,492 --> 00:34:47,620
...then I would be happy

315
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,824
I shall take my leave of you, sire

316
00:35:02,677 --> 00:35:04,668
Wait a moment

317
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:16,023
Up until now, I believed only Wu-hui
could bring happiness into my life

318
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:18,790
But you...

319
00:35:19,861 --> 00:35:24,127
...of your own accord,
played my composition...

320
00:35:24,432 --> 00:35:26,992
...and gave me great comfort

321
00:35:28,002 --> 00:35:31,699
Moreover,
you have asked for no reward

322
00:35:34,442 --> 00:35:35,966
Above all...

323
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:42,439
...you spoke to me with honesty,
as you would address any other person

324
00:35:43,785 --> 00:35:47,448
Not even Wu-hui
was ever able to do that

325
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:54,693
Tell me what your name is

326
00:35:55,997 --> 00:35:59,592
I am Yu-huan of the Yang family,
Your Majesty

327
00:36:03,471 --> 00:36:09,137
Yu-huan, from now on
I wish you to remain close at my side...

328
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:11,071
...as a friend

329
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,746
Only if you wish, of course

330
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:17,480
Yes, sire

331
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,448
I would like that very much

332
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:27,652
That settles it.
You agree to stay at my side?

333
00:36:30,865 --> 00:36:33,459
I take that as a promise

334
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,481
Tomorrow morning...

335
00:36:50,585 --> 00:36:54,646
...I want you to prepare the hot spring
in the Lotus Pool for Yu-huan

336
00:37:52,847 --> 00:37:54,872
Lady Yu-huan...

337
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,646
...since Empress Wu-hui passed away...

338
00:37:58,753 --> 00:38:01,950
...you are the first to have been
allowed to use the Lotus Pool

339
00:38:02,056 --> 00:38:07,722
His Majesty says that spring
has returned to the court!

340
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:19,062
I can't stay long.
I have to leave tomorrow

341
00:38:21,576 --> 00:38:26,138
It's unfortunate that I have to return
to my old life as a provincial governor...

342
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:29,580
...without seeing how
Yu-huan is getting along

343
00:38:36,057 --> 00:38:37,991
Does my presence here
embarrass you?

344
00:38:38,092 --> 00:38:39,992
Please, General...

345
00:38:40,094 --> 00:38:42,688
...a governorship is an honourable post

346
00:38:42,797 --> 00:38:44,992
What use is a provincial governorship?

347
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:47,226
I want a position in the capital

348
00:38:47,335 --> 00:38:52,102
If Li Lin-fu falls from power,
who will be the next premier?

349
00:38:54,108 --> 00:38:57,976
Do you have your sights
set on being premier, General?

350
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,845
One must be ambitious and aim high,
for the premiership...

351
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,111
...or even the imperial throne!

352
00:39:04,953 --> 00:39:06,580
The throne?

353
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:13,683
You just watch, your little kitchen help
may one day become Empress

354
00:39:15,697 --> 00:39:17,164
You're right...

355
00:39:17,265 --> 00:39:19,597
Anything is possible

356
00:39:21,002 --> 00:39:23,334
I will never abandon my ambitions

357
00:39:23,638 --> 00:39:28,041
If Yu-huan becomes influential,
you won't remain here much longer

358
00:39:28,142 --> 00:39:31,737
General, it seems she's already
been accepted as his mistress

359
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:34,144
Being one of his harem means nothing

360
00:39:34,248 --> 00:39:39,049
The important thing is for Yu-huan
to rise above the other women in status

361
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:42,054
The future of the Yang family
depends on it

362
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:45,148
Don't forget that, Chao!

363
00:39:54,902 --> 00:40:00,204
In accordance with the law, sire,
it is dictated that Lady Cheng must die

364
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:07,170
I have no recollection
of issuing such an order

365
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,845
You are the servants of a prisoner!

366
00:40:11,953 --> 00:40:15,946
How dare you presume to speak
in front of His Imperial Majesty!

367
00:40:16,057 --> 00:40:17,251
Get out!

368
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:18,882
Out!

369
00:40:21,195 --> 00:40:26,690
It is strictly forbidden by imperial
decree for any lady in your harem...

370
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:31,238
...to involve herself
in matters of governance

371
00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:36,777
Therefore the penalty
for such a crime is death

372
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:46,746
But Lady Cheng only involved herself
in politics...

373
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:51,086
...because she wanted to secure
a government post for her relative

374
00:40:51,192 --> 00:40:56,425
I am only observing a law that
you yourself decreed, Your Majesty

375
00:40:58,266 --> 00:41:03,329
But laws should be made to safeguard
the well-being of the people

376
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:08,467
Why can't you use the law
for the benefit of the people?

377
00:41:08,776 --> 00:41:12,143
If Your Majesty should care
to make such laws...

378
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:15,147
...then I will faithfully carry them out

379
00:41:15,249 --> 00:41:18,741
However, I must insist that if a law...

380
00:41:18,853 --> 00:41:20,184
Enough!

381
00:41:21,222 --> 00:41:23,213
I have no wish to listen to you

382
00:41:48,516 --> 00:41:50,177
Your Majesty...

383
00:41:52,086 --> 00:41:57,786
I thought that you had the power
to do anything that you wished

384
00:42:00,495 --> 00:42:06,297
For years, I was able to do
as I pleased in all matters

385
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:14,307
But the laws and codes of practice
that I myself made now constrain me...

386
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:17,935
...and the result
is a curtailment of my powers

387
00:42:19,847 --> 00:42:24,341
Sometimes it is important to relax
and forget all your troubles

388
00:42:27,855 --> 00:42:30,323
Forget all my troubles?

389
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:36,286
Let me accompany you, Your Majesty

390
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:39,195
- Where to?
- Into the city

391
00:42:40,201 --> 00:42:45,332
This evening there is an annual festival,
and the whole city will be celebrating

392
00:43:09,597 --> 00:43:11,588
Festival of Lanterns

393
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:29,146
Hold on to me tightly
so I don't lose you, sire

394
00:43:29,617 --> 00:43:32,211
There are servants from the court
approaching

395
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,083
This way

396
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:51,261
That was a narrow escape

397
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,331
Is it all right to remove my hood?
It's so uncomfortable

398
00:44:22,436 --> 00:44:25,428
I'm sure we'll be fine here

399
00:44:38,653 --> 00:44:41,952
- How kind of you, sire
- These are for me?

400
00:44:42,056 --> 00:44:45,423
Many thanks. Please, accept these

401
00:44:47,161 --> 00:44:48,992
Won't you try one?

402
00:44:53,968 --> 00:44:55,230
Try it

403
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:03,499
Tonight, you must do
exactly as I tell you

404
00:45:06,514 --> 00:45:08,175
It's delicious, isn't it?

405
00:45:08,282 --> 00:45:09,647
I'm not sure

406
00:45:09,951 --> 00:45:11,578
Everybody is so kind

407
00:45:11,686 --> 00:45:16,146
This is the first time in a long time
that I've felt so free

408
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:18,248
Aren't you glad you ventured out?

409
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:21,618
These sweets are very tasty

410
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:24,595
Now you see!

411
00:45:42,717 --> 00:45:45,709
We can't allow a pair of lovers
to pass through

412
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,184
- Why not?
- You have to drink before you can pass

413
00:45:50,291 --> 00:45:55,194
- I don't want to trouble you
- You're not troubling us! Have a drink!

414
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:57,389
Please forgive their impertinence

415
00:45:58,466 --> 00:46:02,027
Let's celebrate your wedding!

416
00:46:04,672 --> 00:46:07,004
- One more!
- One more!

417
00:46:13,314 --> 00:46:16,283
First we drink, then we dance!

418
00:47:48,809 --> 00:47:51,744
Your dancing was wonderful

419
00:47:54,148 --> 00:47:57,140
Why did you never
dance for me before?

420
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:04,422
Well, it was the beautiful sound of
your lute that made me want to dance

421
00:48:05,826 --> 00:48:09,592
Your movements kept perfect timing

422
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:14,165
Only because Your Majesty
matched my tempo

423
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:19,297
I've had a marvellous evening

424
00:48:20,274 --> 00:48:23,903
I feel so refreshed
that my blood is tingling

425
00:48:25,913 --> 00:48:28,905
It makes me so happy
to hear you say that

426
00:48:30,918 --> 00:48:34,877
This evening, I don't feel
like an emperor...

427
00:48:35,189 --> 00:48:38,920
...I feel like a man of the people,
you can call me Li San-lan!

428
00:48:39,226 --> 00:48:43,663
Me, too. I'm Yu-huan,
just a simple peasant girl

429
00:48:46,634 --> 00:48:47,931
Majesty...

430
00:48:53,541 --> 00:48:56,271
May we have some tea, please?

431
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:06,242
Careful, it's hot

432
00:49:18,866 --> 00:49:20,197
Here

433
00:49:35,216 --> 00:49:36,877
You know...

434
00:49:36,984 --> 00:49:43,981
...it feels like I've lived here
with you for years and years!

435
00:50:32,039 --> 00:50:37,272
As our governor-generals, it is your
responsibility to defend our borders...

436
00:50:37,378 --> 00:50:40,040
...against the invading barbarians

437
00:50:41,515 --> 00:50:47,647
For a long time they have been
troublesome and war seems inevitable

438
00:50:47,755 --> 00:50:54,058
But it is important to win them over
not by force but by diplomacy

439
00:50:55,929 --> 00:50:59,456
It will all depend on your abilities

440
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:05,363
His Majesty is relying on you
completely, generals...

441
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:08,066
...and each of you is expected
to fulfil his duty

442
00:51:09,410 --> 00:51:12,004
I hope you enjoy this gathering...

443
00:51:12,313 --> 00:51:15,305
...that His Majesty has arranged
in your honour

444
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:21,981
Well, if it isn't General An Lu-shan...

445
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:24,080
Welcome to the capital

446
00:51:28,362 --> 00:51:30,557
Well, Chao...

447
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:37,696
You must call me by the new name
and title that His Majesty gave me

448
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:41,002
So, you're Minister Yang Kuo-chung
now, are you?

449
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:46,045
Close to the throne.
A lofty position indeed

450
00:51:54,788 --> 00:51:57,689
Damn these upstart women!

451
00:51:59,126 --> 00:52:02,926
They live in luxury,
all paid for with our taxes

452
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:08,993
They're just taking advantage
of His Majesty's love for Kuei-fei

453
00:52:09,103 --> 00:52:14,973
They're jumped-up servants who think
they're better than the rest of us

454
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:17,566
Make way for Her Ladyship! Move!

455
00:52:18,912 --> 00:52:20,470
Move!

456
00:52:22,816 --> 00:52:24,807
Move, you bastard!

457
00:52:24,918 --> 00:52:27,443
What do you think you're doing?

458
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:30,750
What are you doing?

459
00:52:31,625 --> 00:52:36,062
The Yang family has corrupted
the whole court!

460
00:52:36,163 --> 00:52:38,063
Death to the Yangs!

461
00:52:38,165 --> 00:52:42,124
Don't just stand there!
Quickly, to the palace!

462
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:58,781
Kill them!

463
00:52:58,886 --> 00:53:02,185
- Death to the Yangs!
- Kill them all!

464
00:53:02,489 --> 00:53:06,789
- Down with the Yangs!
- Kill them!

465
00:53:06,894 --> 00:53:09,419
Kill the Yangs!

466
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:20,103
- What's happened?
- What's happened, madam?

467
00:53:20,207 --> 00:53:24,769
On the way here,
we were attacked by a mob...

468
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:30,115
...and they were shouting,
"Death to the Yang family!"

469
00:53:30,217 --> 00:53:32,117
How frightening for you

470
00:53:32,219 --> 00:53:37,657
How dare they treat friends
of His Majesty this way!

471
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:40,124
They're ruffians!

472
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:42,127
Were they arrested?

473
00:53:42,229 --> 00:53:46,131
Our guards just stood by
and watched them abuse us!

474
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:50,863
You were all useless! Someone must
take responsibility for this!

475
00:53:50,971 --> 00:53:55,101
I apologise, madam.
What were the guards doing?

476
00:53:55,209 --> 00:53:57,871
Are you all right, madam?

477
00:53:57,978 --> 00:54:00,139
What about Kuei-fei?

478
00:54:00,247 --> 00:54:01,839
What happened?

479
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:04,250
Kuei-fei...

480
00:54:06,987 --> 00:54:09,182
Are you hurt?

481
00:54:11,892 --> 00:54:16,955
You were right when you said
one should be ambitious and aim high

482
00:54:18,198 --> 00:54:23,830
And you have been made
governor of three provinces

483
00:54:23,937 --> 00:54:26,906
You must be pleased
with your progress

484
00:54:27,808 --> 00:54:31,266
That's nothing compared
to your promotion, Minister

485
00:54:32,946 --> 00:54:36,746
And to whom do you attribute
your success?

486
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:39,512
I attribute it to my own prowess

487
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:43,852
It certainly hasn't been easy, though

488
00:54:43,957 --> 00:54:47,222
Don't talk nonsense!
It's all due to Kuei-fei

489
00:54:47,528 --> 00:54:51,020
And Kuei-fei, in turn,
owes all she has to me!

490
00:54:51,131 --> 00:54:52,894
Listen, Chao...

491
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:58,267
Promote me to a central government
post and make me a minister

492
00:54:58,572 --> 00:55:02,303
Only the Emperor has the authority
to do that, not me

493
00:55:02,609 --> 00:55:06,170
So arrange for Kuei-fei
to make a request to His Majesty

494
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:09,875
It is forbidden for women
to have any involvement in politics

495
00:55:09,983 --> 00:55:12,042
Listen to me, Chao...

496
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:16,816
...I have now consolidated
my power base in the north

497
00:55:16,924 --> 00:55:20,951
You'd be wise to retain my friendship
if you wish to remain in power

498
00:55:21,061 --> 00:55:23,052
- Minister?
- What is it?

499
00:55:25,165 --> 00:55:30,193
Would you ask His Majesty what music
he'd like the musicians to play next?

500
00:55:31,672 --> 00:55:35,836
I will consider what
you have just said, General

501
00:55:45,018 --> 00:55:50,081
Does Your Majesty have any
particular music you'd like to hear next?

502
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,021
Let me see...

503
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:56,261
I know...

504
00:55:59,833 --> 00:56:03,269
...in honour of my new governors...

505
00:56:05,138 --> 00:56:08,733
...I shall play for them myself

506
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:31,120
It has been a long time, madam

507
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:36,227
Congratulations on your new post,
General

508
00:56:36,336 --> 00:56:39,134
I don't see it as any cause
for celebration

509
00:56:40,674 --> 00:56:45,270
I still nurture my ambition
for a government post in the capital

510
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,972
Yu-huan...

511
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,276
Listen to me...

512
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:59,656
You have become
a very influential concubine at court

513
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:02,228
I want to be a government minister...

514
00:57:02,329 --> 00:57:06,231
...and I have the right to expect
your help on this matter

515
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,234
General, please... not here

516
00:57:09,336 --> 00:57:11,031
What?

517
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:15,797
So, you won't even deign
to listen to what I have to say?

518
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:21,339
Are you too selfish
to think of anyone but yourself?

519
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:25,309
Look how your three sisters
have risen through the ranks

520
00:57:25,419 --> 00:57:30,254
Even Chao has been rewarded
with a ministerial post

521
00:57:30,357 --> 00:57:32,825
Why, then, must I languish
in the provinces?

522
00:57:32,926 --> 00:57:34,791
Please don't raise your voice

523
00:57:34,895 --> 00:57:36,692
- Excuse me
- Wait!

524
00:58:04,324 --> 00:58:06,849
You really are exquisitely beautiful

525
00:58:07,928 --> 00:58:10,863
I never thought
you could look this radiant

526
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:17,036
If only I had taken you for my own
that day we first met...

527
00:58:17,137 --> 00:58:21,005
...both our destinies
would be very different now

528
00:58:21,108 --> 00:58:22,769
Yu-huan...

529
00:58:22,876 --> 00:58:24,901
What are you doing?

530
00:58:26,246 --> 00:58:28,942
I belong to the Emperor now

531
00:58:29,049 --> 00:58:31,347
What do you mean,
"belong to the Emperor"?

532
00:58:31,451 --> 00:58:34,318
You mustn't forget, Yu-huan...

533
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:39,017
...it was I who took you away
from the drudgery of life in the kitchen

534
00:58:39,126 --> 00:58:46,089
And has His Majesty not generously
rewarded you for your efforts?

535
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:50,164
Some reward, indeed!

536
00:58:51,805 --> 00:58:53,102
Yu-huan...

537
00:58:53,206 --> 00:58:56,903
Surely you've heard that the people
are cursing the Yang family?

538
00:58:59,045 --> 00:59:04,779
Do you not see how the nation suffers
under a heavy taxation system...

539
00:59:04,885 --> 00:59:09,117
...while Chao abuses his position
and lines his own pockets?

540
00:59:10,157 --> 00:59:15,390
And your three sisters lead a life
of ostentatious decadence

541
00:59:18,165 --> 00:59:22,067
The people may revolt
at any moment...

542
00:59:22,169 --> 00:59:25,900
...and when they do,
it'll be the Yang family they'll be after

543
00:59:26,807 --> 00:59:30,265
If it goes on like this, even
the Emperor's life may be in danger

544
00:59:36,983 --> 00:59:41,443
Even the Emperor was once
nothing more than a provincial warlord

545
00:59:41,555 --> 00:59:43,352
Fortune favours the mighty...

546
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:47,449
...and any mighty feudal lord
can make himself Emperor!

547
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,589
Listen, Yu-huan...

548
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:54,389
My future is as boundless as an ocean

549
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:59,962
Why don't you accompany me
to my fortress?

550
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:03,133
This is the only way
you can save yourself now

551
01:00:03,243 --> 01:00:05,905
Kuei-fei!

552
01:00:06,012 --> 01:00:09,504
Kuei-fei, His Majesty
has finished his recital now

553
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:36,608
But why are you telling me this
all of a sudden? Tell me the reason

554
01:00:41,548 --> 01:00:46,008
The whole nation seems to be burning
with rage at the Yang family

555
01:00:48,555 --> 01:00:52,548
Please let me return
to my former life as Yu-huan...

556
01:00:52,659 --> 01:00:58,427
...and discharge my cousin Kuo-chung
and my three sisters from the court

557
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,625
Your three sisters
are of no consequence

558
01:01:03,904 --> 01:01:07,931
And as for promoting Kuo-chung
to a ministerial position...

559
01:01:08,041 --> 01:01:11,374
...I have my own ulterior motive
for doing that

560
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:18,413
I would never be foolish enough
to allow my feelings for you...

561
01:01:18,518 --> 01:01:21,282
...to jeopardise the governance
of the country

562
01:01:21,388 --> 01:01:25,290
I'm not thinking of just
Your Majesty's safety...

563
01:01:25,392 --> 01:01:27,587
...but for the safety
of the whole country

564
01:01:27,694 --> 01:01:29,286
Wait!

565
01:01:35,068 --> 01:01:36,296
Kuei-fei...

566
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:41,204
...I am sure that you are aware
of the consequences...

567
01:01:41,308 --> 01:01:45,472
...if a consort involves herself
in the affairs of the state

568
01:01:48,014 --> 01:01:51,006
Of course I am aware, sire

569
01:01:51,117 --> 01:01:56,180
Therefore, please punish me
as you see fit

570
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:00,692
Are you saying that you have
no compunction about leaving me?

571
01:02:06,366 --> 01:02:10,325
Perhaps I have committed a crime...

572
01:02:11,638 --> 01:02:15,335
...and I am no longer worthy
of the title of consort

573
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:22,343
Are you so willing to listen to what
others have to say rather than me?

574
01:02:24,084 --> 01:02:26,552
The other evening...

575
01:02:26,653 --> 01:02:31,283
...the whole court knew that
you were talking alone with An Lu-shan

576
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:34,451
Majesty, you must trust me, please

577
01:02:36,329 --> 01:02:39,264
But you are still determined
to leave me?

578
01:02:39,366 --> 01:02:41,425
Please forgive me!

579
01:02:44,137 --> 01:02:45,365
Enough!

580
01:02:49,075 --> 01:02:50,372
Master Kao!

581
01:02:53,046 --> 01:02:56,641
Take Kuei-fei
to the harem immediately

582
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,274
But Your Majesty...

583
01:02:58,385 --> 01:03:01,149
Do as I command!

584
01:03:40,627 --> 01:03:43,357
Premier Li... what is it you want?

585
01:03:43,463 --> 01:03:45,328
Majesty...

586
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:58,476
I heard that you have
dismissed Kuei-fei

587
01:04:00,113 --> 01:04:07,849
I must say, Your Majesty, that I admire
your decision and congratulate you

588
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:12,620
Is that all you came to say?

589
01:04:12,725 --> 01:04:14,124
Yes, sire

590
01:04:21,668 --> 01:04:27,106
Kuo-chung, I hear you've been taking
advantage of my illness...

591
01:04:27,207 --> 01:04:30,335
...and have been acting
as though you were the Premier

592
01:04:30,443 --> 01:04:33,435
All with the blessing of His Majesty

593
01:04:35,148 --> 01:04:38,174
Surely you should be
considering retirement

594
01:04:38,284 --> 01:04:42,118
You're too infirm to deal
with the pressures of being Premier

595
01:04:42,822 --> 01:04:47,623
I'll see that you receive notification
of discharge of your duties

596
01:04:47,727 --> 01:04:50,890
I won't hear such insolence!

597
01:04:51,197 --> 01:04:52,459
Silence!

598
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:13,184
Your Majesty, Kuei-fei refused
to enter the harem...

599
01:05:13,286 --> 01:05:15,846
...but went to the house
of her cousin Yang Hsien

600
01:05:16,156 --> 01:05:17,350
What?

601
01:05:17,457 --> 01:05:20,722
It's unacceptable for such
a noble lady of the court...

602
01:05:20,827 --> 01:05:24,422
...to stay in the house of a commoner

603
01:05:24,531 --> 01:05:28,331
On your orders, I shall go and find her

604
01:05:28,434 --> 01:05:32,393
We will bring her back immediately, sire

605
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:42,403
I'm so glad that
you have come back here

606
01:05:43,415 --> 01:05:47,374
It's better for your sisters
and for Chao as well

607
01:05:57,696 --> 01:06:01,223
You can remain here
as long as you wish

608
01:06:09,575 --> 01:06:12,408
I will protect you with my life

609
01:06:13,779 --> 01:06:17,408
But what are your plans for the future?

610
01:06:18,717 --> 01:06:22,380
I wish to become Yu-huan once again

611
01:06:22,488 --> 01:06:25,753
You rose too high too quickly...

612
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:29,419
...that was your misfortune

613
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:43,705
<i>There are many and varied ways...</i>

614
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:48,940
<i>... to live a good life</i>

615
01:06:50,015 --> 01:06:56,784
<i>The province where I was born...</i>

616
01:06:56,889 --> 01:07:01,792
<i>... is where I yearn to return</i>

617
01:07:04,496 --> 01:07:11,368
<i>As they hang on the frame</i>
<i>over the door...</i>

618
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:16,464
<i>... the grapes are ripening</i>

619
01:07:17,476 --> 01:07:24,973
<i>The sun is high in the sky...</i>

620
01:07:41,467 --> 01:07:44,527
When did you arrive here
from the provinces?

621
01:07:44,636 --> 01:07:47,332
- Last year
- Really?

622
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,907
- Do you like it here?
- Yes

623
01:08:13,532 --> 01:08:17,593
Kuei-fei, what are you doing
in such a filthy place?

624
01:08:22,541 --> 01:08:27,535
Master Kao and I have come
to take you back to the palace

625
01:08:29,715 --> 01:08:32,115
I wish to see no one

626
01:08:34,019 --> 01:08:36,647
But the Emperor himself has sent us

627
01:09:02,581 --> 01:09:07,712
His Majesty ordered us
to bring you back immediately

628
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:10,118
Please get ready
as quickly as possible

629
01:09:10,422 --> 01:09:13,414
Your palanquin is waiting

630
01:09:16,995 --> 01:09:18,758
I will not go back

631
01:09:21,667 --> 01:09:25,569
I prefer to stay here

632
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:39,545
This is all your fault, Hsien

633
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:42,779
You should be worried
about your own future!

634
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:45,652
The people of Chang'an
are after your blood!

635
01:09:45,757 --> 01:09:49,454
It's impossible for a politician
to please everyone

636
01:09:49,561 --> 01:09:54,464
Consider how you have lorded it
over the whole nation

637
01:09:54,566 --> 01:09:57,501
You should resign from your post.
It is her wish also

638
01:09:57,603 --> 01:09:59,195
What do you know about anything?

639
01:09:59,505 --> 01:10:01,200
She is concerned for you!

640
01:10:01,507 --> 01:10:03,134
Don't be so insolent!

641
01:10:03,442 --> 01:10:05,876
- You damn upstart!
- What?

642
01:10:09,515 --> 01:10:12,177
Someone help me!

643
01:10:24,530 --> 01:10:26,088
What insolence!

644
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:33,199
We cannot just stand by idly
and watch our country fall!

645
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,906
We must destroy the Yang family
and save the empire!

646
01:10:43,248 --> 01:10:48,686
By favouring the Yangs, His Majesty
must also share some of the blame!

647
01:10:51,056 --> 01:10:58,155
It is time to usher in a new era!
The nation must have a new ruler!

648
01:10:59,831 --> 01:11:03,665
Our objective is to take
the capital, Chang'an!

649
01:11:03,769 --> 01:11:06,738
Onwards to the capital!

650
01:11:13,712 --> 01:11:19,912
<i>In an attempt to destroy the Tangs</i>
<i>and usurp the imperial throne...</i>

651
01:11:20,018 --> 01:11:24,512
<i>... General An Lu-shan</i>
<i>heads a revolution</i>

652
01:11:26,058 --> 01:11:29,619
<i>Giving himself the title</i>
<i>Emperor Taien...</i>

653
01:11:29,728 --> 01:11:35,064
<i>... he advances with his army</i>
<i>toward the capital, Chang'an</i>

654
01:11:51,049 --> 01:11:55,145
<i>Learning of the perils now threatening</i>
<i>the life of Emperor Hsüan-tsung...</i>

655
01:11:55,254 --> 01:11:59,281
<i>... Kuei-fei decides</i>
<i>to return to him immediately...</i>

656
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:03,789
<i>... to be by his side</i>
<i>and face their fate together</i>

657
01:12:03,895 --> 01:12:09,925
<i>Despite the many dangers,</i>
<i>she remains resolute and unafraid</i>

658
01:12:22,014 --> 01:12:28,715
<i>Emperor Hsüan-tsung flees the capital,</i>
<i>and after an arduous journey...</i>

659
01:12:28,820 --> 01:12:33,848
<i>... they rest in Mukuai,</i>
<i>a desolate village</i>

660
01:12:38,964 --> 01:12:41,159
Let me do this for you

661
01:12:41,266 --> 01:12:43,860
You go and see to His Majesty

662
01:12:43,969 --> 01:12:46,233
No, I'll prepare it

663
01:12:47,939 --> 01:12:52,967
He looks exhausted.
Take this to him quickly

664
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,306
Yes, madam

665
01:13:38,323 --> 01:13:42,692
Forgive me, I'm afraid this is all
we can serve you, Majesty

666
01:13:42,794 --> 01:13:46,958
And what about my men?
Aren't they hungry, too?

667
01:13:47,065 --> 01:13:49,659
They'll be fed soon

668
01:13:49,768 --> 01:13:51,395
I see...

669
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:18,423
No!

670
01:14:19,998 --> 01:14:21,727
What's happening?

671
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:33,437
Look, men!

672
01:14:33,745 --> 01:14:37,704
We've killed the three Yang sisters!

673
01:14:37,816 --> 01:14:40,216
We've killed each one of them!

674
01:14:40,318 --> 01:14:42,718
The people demanded their execution!

675
01:14:43,722 --> 01:14:49,820
Listen, why did we flee from the capital
without putting up a fight?

676
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:54,730
We Imperial Guards are a disgrace!

677
01:14:56,334 --> 01:14:59,167
General An's forces are
growing in strength!

678
01:14:59,271 --> 01:15:02,297
Everyone who's anti-government
is joining his ranks!

679
01:15:02,407 --> 01:15:06,002
They're angry with the politicians
Kuo-chung and Kao!

680
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:10,480
We have no ill-feeling
towards His Imperial Majesty!

681
01:15:10,782 --> 01:15:14,377
It was for His Majesty's sake that
we executed the three Yang sisters!

682
01:15:14,486 --> 01:15:18,183
General An isn't our enemy,
it's the Yang family!

683
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:21,885
The next to be executed will be
Yang Kuo-chung and Kao Li-hsi!

684
01:15:35,774 --> 01:15:39,301
Commander, we must leave
as soon as the men have eaten

685
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:43,973
General An has crossed the river
and is advancing on Cheng-Tu

686
01:15:45,116 --> 01:15:46,447
Understood, sir

687
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:52,517
What are you doing?

688
01:15:54,059 --> 01:15:55,856
Prepare to move out!

689
01:16:05,036 --> 01:16:07,027
What's going on?

690
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:13,107
It is Premier Yang Kuo-chung
who is to blame for all this

691
01:16:13,211 --> 01:16:16,544
Unless he's punished,
the troops won't move an inch!

692
01:16:16,848 --> 01:16:20,045
Silence! Who's the ringleader?
I want his head!

693
01:16:20,151 --> 01:16:21,846
It's a unanimous decision

694
01:16:21,953 --> 01:16:25,821
We decided to kill the three
Yang sisters as a blood sacrifice

695
01:16:25,924 --> 01:16:29,917
You're powerless
to stand in our way now

696
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:33,486
- Seize him!
- No... no!

697
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:37,867
Back, you insolent fools!

698
01:16:40,505 --> 01:16:43,201
Kill Kuo-chung!

699
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,508
Kuei-fei...

700
01:16:53,184 --> 01:16:56,051
I regret having caused you
so much hardship

701
01:16:57,289 --> 01:16:59,951
Being here alone with you...

702
01:17:01,293 --> 01:17:05,389
...it reminds me of that night we spent
during the Festival of Lanterns

703
01:17:05,497 --> 01:17:08,295
The memories are comforting to me

704
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:13,167
It heartens me
to see you so cheerful, Majesty

705
01:17:14,172 --> 01:17:17,869
It takes a lot more than this
to cause me despair

706
01:17:20,645 --> 01:17:22,203
What is it?

707
01:17:26,451 --> 01:17:28,043
It's terrible

708
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:31,919
Kuo-chung and the three Yang sisters
were seized by the enemy...

709
01:17:32,023 --> 01:17:34,651
- What?
...and they have been executed

710
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:37,485
Kuo-chung and the three sisters?

711
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:40,588
The situation is beyond my control,
Majesty

712
01:17:40,899 --> 01:17:43,129
Please strip me of my title, sire

713
01:17:43,234 --> 01:17:46,499
- What for?
- We are being besieged, sire

714
01:17:46,605 --> 01:17:49,904
Why? Is this a revolt against me?

715
01:17:50,008 --> 01:17:53,034
The army is not disloyal to you, sire

716
01:17:53,144 --> 01:17:55,135
Majesty...

717
01:17:55,246 --> 01:17:58,044
You see... Kuei-fei...

718
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:59,946
What about Kuei-fei?

719
01:18:00,051 --> 01:18:01,450
Well...

720
01:18:01,553 --> 01:18:04,147
Kuei-fei,
would you leave us a moment...?

721
01:18:04,255 --> 01:18:07,986
Wait! Why can't Kuei-fei
remain here?

722
01:18:08,093 --> 01:18:11,529
Your Majesty, please excuse me

723
01:18:23,675 --> 01:18:25,267
Kuei-fei!

724
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:40,417
Master Kao, what is it you wish
to tell me without Kuei-fei present?

725
01:18:40,525 --> 01:18:44,188
The executions of Kuo-chung
and the three sisters...

726
01:18:44,295 --> 01:18:46,195
...have not appeased the people

727
01:18:46,297 --> 01:18:50,700
Your Majesty, the soldiers are
demanding the life of Kuei-fei

728
01:18:51,002 --> 01:18:53,493
- What? They want Kuei-fei?
- Yes, sire

729
01:18:53,605 --> 01:18:56,199
Never! Never!

730
01:18:56,708 --> 01:19:01,372
Women of the harem have
no responsibility for affairs of state

731
01:19:01,479 --> 01:19:04,573
However, I have to say that
under the circumstances...

732
01:19:04,683 --> 01:19:09,017
...she is considered a member
of the Yang family, sire

733
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:12,419
Kao... do you intend to betray us?

734
01:19:13,525 --> 01:19:18,155
Was it not you who recommended
Kuei-fei to me?

735
01:19:18,263 --> 01:19:21,232
And now you intend to kill her?

736
01:19:21,332 --> 01:19:25,234
Majesty... your life is in danger!

737
01:19:25,336 --> 01:19:28,169
We must make a decision
to save you and the nation

738
01:19:28,273 --> 01:19:32,232
Silence! What do you mean,
to save me and the nation?

739
01:19:32,343 --> 01:19:35,176
Have you ever considered
your country before now?

740
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:37,475
You're just trying to save your own skin!

741
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:39,482
No, Your Majesty, no!

742
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:42,246
The soldiers are baying for blood...

743
01:19:42,353 --> 01:19:45,254
...they've lost all reason,
they're going berserk!

744
01:19:45,356 --> 01:19:46,550
Majesty!

745
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:49,149
What are you doing?

746
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:52,559
The soldiers are demanding
your life first, Kao!

747
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:56,725
- What? No!
- You're a traitor and must die!

748
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:14,715
Forgive me, sire, for spilling blood
in your presence

749
01:20:14,819 --> 01:20:17,379
I will pay the penalty, sire

750
01:20:18,656 --> 01:20:20,749
Never mind about that

751
01:20:21,059 --> 01:20:23,493
I must speak to the troops

752
01:20:23,595 --> 01:20:25,392
Please wait!

753
01:20:37,142 --> 01:20:41,169
- You must hand over Kuei-fei!
- We are loyal to you, sire!

754
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:42,746
Wait!

755
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:44,838
Calm yourselves down

756
01:20:45,150 --> 01:20:48,449
Listen to what I have to say...

757
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:50,111
Kuei-fei!

758
01:20:50,221 --> 01:20:52,314
...Kuei-fei is blameless

759
01:21:03,334 --> 01:21:05,802
Majesty, Kuei-fei
is from the Yang family

760
01:21:06,104 --> 01:21:09,335
Your life is in danger, sire.
It is for your own safety

761
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,206
You must make a decision quickly,
Majesty!

762
01:21:39,637 --> 01:21:44,540
All of you have been
so attentive to me over the years

763
01:21:49,514 --> 01:21:55,475
Pray for the quick restoration of peace
and the return of His Majesty to power

764
01:21:59,524 --> 01:22:05,895
I am praying for the return
of a peaceful springtime...

765
01:22:06,197 --> 01:22:10,293
...when the beautiful plum trees
will once again blossom...

766
01:22:10,401 --> 01:22:14,565
...and people can celebrate
the Festival of Lanterns

767
01:22:14,672 --> 01:22:19,371
I pray with all my heart
that those days arrive soon

768
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:46,266
Hung-tao...

769
01:22:51,542 --> 01:22:54,534
Please give this to His Majesty from me

770
01:22:55,546 --> 01:22:57,707
Tell him...

771
01:22:57,815 --> 01:23:01,842
...that I shall always and forever
be by his side

772
01:23:03,288 --> 01:23:06,553
- Will you tell him that?
- Yes, madam

773
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:20,827
- You must come with us
- Prepare yourself!

774
01:23:37,655 --> 01:23:39,589
Let us proceed

775
01:27:36,594 --> 01:27:38,084
Kuei-fei...

776
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:44,795
Kuei-fei...

777
01:27:57,248 --> 01:28:01,514
Will peace now be restored
to my nation?

778
01:28:18,536 --> 01:28:21,767
<i>After you passed away...</i>

779
01:28:21,872 --> 01:28:25,865
<i>... there was nothing left for me</i>
<i>in this world</i>

780
01:28:25,977 --> 01:28:30,710
<i>General An Lu-shan</i>
<i>soon met his demise...</i>

781
01:28:30,815 --> 01:28:32,646
<i>... but by then...</i>

782
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:36,015
<i>... my imperial throne</i>
<i>had been usurped...</i>

783
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:40,147
<i>... by my very own son,</i>
<i>the Crown Prince</i>

784
01:28:41,292 --> 01:28:47,561
<i>He was no different</i>
<i>from An Lu-shan after all</i>

785
01:28:48,566 --> 01:28:53,868
<i>There was never any love</i>
<i>lost between us</i>

786
01:28:54,972 --> 01:28:58,339
<i>What a heartless world we live in</i>

787
01:29:08,586 --> 01:29:10,577
<i>Kuei-fei...</i>

788
01:29:14,625 --> 01:29:16,286
<i>Kuei-fei...</i>

789
01:29:18,596 --> 01:29:19,995
<i>Majesty...</i>

790
01:29:21,265 --> 01:29:24,666
<i>... I have come to take you</i>
<i>away with me</i>

791
01:29:24,769 --> 01:29:27,169
<i>Oh, Kuei-fei?</i>

792
01:29:28,172 --> 01:29:33,769
<i>I have been waiting</i>
<i>for this moment for many years</i>

793
01:29:34,779 --> 01:29:38,180
<i>Finally, the day has come</i>

794
01:29:39,984 --> 01:29:42,976
<i>Give me your hand, Majesty</i>

795
01:29:44,322 --> 01:29:47,348
<i>Let me guide you</i>

796
01:29:47,658 --> 01:29:50,855
<i>I have waited so long for this</i>

797
01:29:50,961 --> 01:29:55,091
<i>We'll be together forever now.</i>
<i>I'll never let you leave my side</i>

798
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,167
<i>Majesty...</i>

799
01:29:57,268 --> 01:30:04,071
<i>no one can ever</i>
<i>tear us asunder this time</i>

800
01:30:04,175 --> 01:30:07,201
<i>Now we can be truly happy</i>

801
01:30:08,379 --> 01:30:10,711
<i>Yes, truly happy</i>

802
01:30:12,116 --> 01:30:15,984
<i>And our happiness shall know no end</i>

803
01:30:20,024 --> 01:30:24,393
<i>I can see you smiling now, my dearest</i>

804
01:30:44,982 --> 01:30:51,251
The End
